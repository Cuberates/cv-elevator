# CV-Elevator
Elevator powered by Computer Vision (CV) Technology (Prototype)

## What is this?
In order to fully comprehend the shear confusion of this repo, I want to talk about the TechGenius Competition 2021 organized by the RMIT University. In the competition, a team consisted of 3 members were given around 2-3 months to come up with a technological solution for the COVID19 pandemic, and our team decided to develop an elevator system that could be controlled without direct contact with the buttons to minimize viral transmission as much as possible. With that being said, this repo contains all of our project files, which are not that many. Moreover, I just learned how to program in Python just then, so joining the competition was also a good way to enhance my skillz.

## Required frameworks / libraries:
To test our project, it is helpful to install some essential Python libraries, such as: MediaPipe, OpenCV, PySerial. (Using `pip3 install`) and configure your Arduino UNO3 (Port, Baud Rate, ...).

## Any updates?
I have decided to halt this project as it would just take too much resource to continue any further. Moreover, the same piece of technology has been slowly putting into use, so there is no point in trying to perfect it.
